# Server_chat
Python script with a Tkinter that allows you to open a local chat room
to begin. You'll have to start the server-side script and run it. 
You must choose which IP address you want the chatroom to run on.
If you want to use your IP address, a custom option allows you to put your IP address.
After running the server, you should run the client-side script on any device(if your server runs on a custom IP address).
