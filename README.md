# Server_chat
Python script with tkinter that allows you to open a local chat room
To begn you'll have to start the server side script and run it. 
You will have to choose which IP address you want the chatroom to run on.
If you want to use your own IP adrress there's a custom option that allows you to put your own IP address.
After running the server you should run the client side script on any device(if your server is running on custom IP address).
